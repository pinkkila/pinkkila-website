                Hi! My name is Petteri and I’m a software development student at
                Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, specializing in
                full-stack web development.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my studies and personal projects, I have focused on building
                applications using Java with Spring Boot and TypeScript with
                React. I have hands-on experience with AWS and have built CI/CD
                pipelines. I have implemented testing in my projects and have a
                solid foundation in Linux system administration. My studies have
                also covered penetration testing and network security, giving
                me a strong awareness of modern security challenges and the
                importance of building applications with security in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a fast and efficient learner. I have an average grade of
                4.91 in key/professional competence studies at Haaga-Helia.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hold a BBA in Sales and Marketing and have hands-on experience
                in sales. I bring not only technical skills but also a strong
                understanding of business needs and a proven ability to provide
                excellent customer service.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I play guitar and plan to return to playing
                ice-hockey in the near future.
